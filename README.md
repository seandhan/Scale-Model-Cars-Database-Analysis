## ✨ Recommendations <a name = "recommnendations"></a>

After having analysed the data based on the queries put forward by the Vehicle Model Company, the following are the recommendations that we could make based on the insights we have gained.

1. To optimize inventory, classic cars and motorcycles should be prioritized for restocking due to high demand, while vintage cars and planes can be managed at a steady pace given even interest over time. For slow-moving deadstock, consider strategic price reductions to increase appeal and accelerate sales. Though counterintuitive, lower prices could reduce losses compared to prolonging costs by holding deadstock. This balanced approach can align inventory to demand and minimize financial burden of deadstock.

2. Personalized interactions and recognition of loyal customers can build long-term relationships and repeat business. For VIP customers, we can offer exclusive, tailored events and initiatives to increase satisfaction and loyalty. For less engaged customers, targeted campaigns based on their needs and preferences can reinvigorate interest in our brand.

3. We should prioritize marketing in North America (USA), Europe (Spain, France), and Oceania (Australia, New Zealand). Concentrating on these targeted markets can improve efficiency and pursue the most promising opportunities. This focused approach can enhance overall business performance
